# 3. Brief information about yourself.
My goal, of course, is to realize myself, develop, learn new things. Find myself, find an interesting job that I like, which I can be proud of, which will bring me a high income.

The priority is of course the family, their opinion is very important to me. I want them to be proud of me. I want not to depend on my family, but rather to help them. I hope I won't let them down.

I am ready to quickly learn and learn new things when I really understand that I am interested in this, that I need it. Support and feedback are very important to me. If I'm learning anything new, I need a "teacher". At school, I did not notice this, everything worked out for me, the teachers supported me, and I graduated from school with a gold medal. But when I entered the university, it became hard for me. Especially if it is an IT university: there are a lot of students, teachers cannot devote separate time to a student, you need to look for a lot of additional information yourself.

I am very glad that I found the "rsschool" school, even though it is so late. I like the approach to teaching at this school. I like that there is good material at the initial stage. I like that there is control and verification of knowledge in the form of tests. I like the fact that there are deadlines, this also motivates you to learn faster.
